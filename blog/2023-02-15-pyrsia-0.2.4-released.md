## Announcing Release 0.2.4 this Valentine's day

We are happy to announce the release of [version 0.2.4](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/releases/tag/v0.2.4) today!

We are our continued journey on a small & frequent release schedule. This is to allow us to release consistently and in
small increments.

A couple of big announcements we would like to make with this release:

* We are happy to announce the release of a [VSCode extension for Pyrsia](2023-02-14-vscode-pyrsia-extension.md) - this will help developers bring secure images from Pyrsia into their development.
* As of this release we now have a cloud node also deployed in AWS thus increasing the resilience of Pyrsia network.

We continue to make incremental updates to improve the network :

* Pyrsia now has extended transparency log search - try it out
* We updated to Rust version 1.66.1, which also helped us resolving vulnerabilities and clippy issues we had with 1.64
* We updated the tool chain to use new github actions - we are now using the ones that are being supported by the rust community

Our [the milestone definition](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/milestone/10) for the next release will cover what we are planning next.

Please [download our installers](https://pyrsia.io/docs/tutorials/quick-installation/), try out Pyrsia with Docker and
[let us know](https://pyrsia.io/docs/community/get_involved/) if you are looking for something Pyrsia does not support
yet.
