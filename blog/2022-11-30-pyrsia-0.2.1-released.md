## Announcing a new release

We are happy to announce the release of [version 0.2.1](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/releases/tag/v0.2.1) today!

This release has incremental improvements over the [version 0.2.0](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/releases/tag/v0.2.0) released at the CDSummit at Kubecon.

Other than usual software quality improvements this release includes the following:

* Better CLI experience - easy to configure
* MacOSX installer is able to start the service automatically - better experience for getting started.
* Automatically request builds on Pyrsia if an artifact does not exist on the network.
* Improved and updated documentation

## Integration tests and Staging environment

We invested a lot of time in this release to improve our testing etiquette.

We now have a set of [integration tests](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia-integration-tests) that we rely on to ensure that the network is stable and the functionality Pyrsia offers, continues to remain stable.

We did not have a dedicated infrastructure to test before going to production. As of this release we have a staging environment that allows us to test before we deploy to production.

More testing is better!

Please [download our installers](https://pyrsia.io/docs/tutorials/quick-installation/), try out Pyrsia with Docker and [let us know](https://pyrsia.io/docs/community/get_involved/) if you are looking for something Pyrsia does not support yet.
