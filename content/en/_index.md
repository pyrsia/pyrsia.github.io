<h1 class="text-center">State of Supply Chain Security</h1>
<hr>
</div>

At various conferences this year, Supply Chain Security has been the most talked about subject. We care about improving the security of open source software and supply chain security of these libraries that are critical for software development.

Pyrsia, a decentralized package network, aims to provide a solution for a key part of the supply chain by building trust for the open-source packages being used as dependencies in software development through certified and peer-verified builds. This certified decentralized package network that understands package coordinates, semantics, and discoverability, and which continues to work even though there are local outages.

If the open-source supply chain was compared to an electric power delivery system, it would be analogous to the power grid that supplies distributed electricity to consumers and businesses worldwide. Individuals, small businesses, and enterprises all depend upon reliable delivery of clean power from upstream production sources. The distributed nature of the power grid makes it possible to have a reliable source of power that efficiently distributes electricity production. Without this critical infrastructure it would be impossible to keep production working globally.

Similarly, open-source software plays an essential role in the supply chain of modern software development. Proprietary software is typically composed of 90% or more open-source dependencies, with heavy usage on packages provided from one or more central repositories including Maven Central, PyPI, RubyGems, NPM, Docker Hub and others. Outages in these upstream repositories have the potential to produce disruptions in the software supply chain that range from developer productivity to CI/CD build failures to interruption of production releases. Worse yet, security issues in central repositories can have a devastating impact on downstream systems, especially where malicious packages have been injected.

Pyrsia aims to secure the software supply chain of open-source dependencies by creating a system that secures open-source builds and distribution by design.

<h1 class="text-center">History of Pyrsia - Communication Network</h1>
<hr>
</div>

{{% blocks/feature_dual %}}
Kleoxenus and Democletus invented [Pyrsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phryctoria) to communicate across great distances.  The method used two sets of torches and a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square) containing the letters of the alphabet.  Number of torches in one set represented the X axis of the square, the other set the Y axis.  Combining these two locations on the square gave you the letter of the alphabet.  

Also, the square could be combined with a [cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square#Cryptography) to send secure messages.
