## Getting Started

Before submitting code to Pyrsia, there are a few things you should know. From completing a contributor license agreement to understanding the different levels of participation, the below information will help you get started.

### Sign the CLA

If you would like to contribute code, documentation content, blogs or graphics you will need to complete the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/pyrsia/pyrsia.github.io) 

If your organization would like to become a contributing organization, please have the appropriate individual complete the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/pyrsia/pyrsia.github.io). We welcome organizations of any size to be part of solving the microservice puzzle and encourage you to get your organization involved.

### Read the Code of Conduct

Just as all open source communities, Pyrsia has a 'Code of Conduct.' Please make sure to read and observe the [Code of Conduct and Community Values](https://github.com/pyrsia/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

### Learn the Community Expectations and Roles

Pyrsia is a community project. Consequently, it is wholly dependent on its community to provide a productive, friendly and collaborative environment.  Our contributors fit into 3 basic categories: Casual, Regular and Core.

**User Contributors:** Adopting Pyrsia, finding bugs, opening tickets, helping others, creating blogs, and providing feedback are the main tasks of User Contributors. Users Contributors are the heartbeat of the Pyrsia Community.  Your involvement at this level drives the Pyrsia road map.

**Member Contributors:**
Working on support tickets is one of the main jobs of the Member Contributor. Member Contributors want to contribute further to the project and will assign themselves support tickets and begin to review pull request. In addition, sharing use cases, providing feedback for potential feature enhancements, and social networking about Pyrsia are a few ways the Member Contributor can participate.  Member Contributors are an important group of individuals as they are the most influential group of contributors. Member Contributors should plan on attending the General Community Meetings monthly to keep up to date with the progress of Pyrsia.

**Reviewer Contributors:**
Reviewing the Member Contributor pull request, attending meetings on a monthly to bi-monthly basis, stepping up to help with working group tasks, and fixing issues best describe the activities that can qualify you as Reviewer Contributor. Reviewer Contributors complete a large part of the work that needs to be done to keep the Pyrsia project relevant to the broader IT community. Your participation at this level is key to the success of the project. 

**Approvers Contributors:**
Approvers Contributors are individuals that have developed a level of expertise and provide a final approval of pull request.  In addition they develop product enhancements, create documentation, develop on-line videos and tutorial content.

**Chairs:**
Providing additional project management support, distribute issues to beginners, manage meetings and recordings are the jobs performed by the Chairs. Chairs need to attend most meetings and help new Contributors be successful.

You are encouraged to participate at all levels. You can move up the ladder as your personal time allows. 

## Understand Submittal Reviews

All submissions, from code to content will require a review. Where possible GitHub pull requests will be used for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.
