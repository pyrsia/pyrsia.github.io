Join a SIG or attend our General meetings. We look forward to your help and input on the Pyrsia project:

- **General Community Meeting** – this is an ‘all hands’ meeting giving the SIGs an opportunity to share their progress.
- **Architecture SIG** – This group is driven to help define the architectural details, development requirements and future roadmap of Pyrsia.
- **Outreach SIG** – This group wants to help with driving adoption and messaging of the Pyrsia.
